# Metronome
This is a metronome with a modern looking UI and with two main functions : Classic Metronome &amp; Incremental Metronome.In the classic metronome mode we have a basic metronome with two knobs,a slide bar and a button to start.In incremental metronome we have a metronome which increments by the value user picks per a bar(musical term).
